# P&L Fix Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed:

### Simple P&L Calculation
- **Before**: Complex calculation with unrealized P&L
- **After**: Simple formula: `Current Balance - $1900`

### Every AI Starts at $1900
- All AIs use $1900 as baseline
- P&L = How far they are from $1900
- Updates every 2 minutes automatically

## Example:
- AI Balance: $1925.54
- P&L: $25.54 (+1.34%)

- AI Balance: $1875.00  
- P&L: -$25.00 (-1.32%)

## No Restart Needed!
The changes will take effect on the next 2-minute balance update cycle.

## What You'll See:
- Correct P&L percentages (not 0%)
- Simple difference from $1900 baseline
- Updates every 2 minutes
- Shows overall portfolio performance
