# Complete P&L Fix Applied âœ…

## Server Restarted Successfully
- Killed all Node.js processes
- Cleared .next cache
- Started fresh server

## All P&L Calculations Fixed

### Backend (ai-automation.ts):
```javascript
// Simple calculation from $1900 baseline
status.totalPnL = status.totalBalance - 1900;
status.totalPnLPercent = (status.totalPnL / 1900) * 100;
```

### Frontend Fixed:
1. **Homepage** - Uses `totalPnLPercent` from backend
2. **AI Arena** - Uses simple P&L, not effectiveBalance
3. **Leaderboard** - Sorted by P&L performance

## What You Should See Now:

### Backend is ALREADY Working:
- AI2: P&L: $-22.64 (-1.19%)
- AI3: P&L: $-5.46 (-0.29%)
- AI5: P&L: $-28.69 (-1.51%)
- AI4: P&L: $1.26 (0.07%)
- AI6: P&L: $1.68 (0.09%)

### Frontend Will Show:
- Real P&L percentages (not 0%)
- Simple difference from $1900
- Updates every 2 minutes

## To See Changes:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console for debug logs

The P&L is calculated as: **Current Balance - $1900**

That's it. Simple and clean! ðŸŽ¯
