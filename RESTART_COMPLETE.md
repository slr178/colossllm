# Server Restart Complete ✅

## What I Did:

1. **Killed all Node.js processes** (3 processes terminated)
2. **Deleted .next cache folder** 
3. **Started fresh server**

## The P&L Fix is Working!

Looking at your logs, the backend IS calculating P&L correctly:
- AI2: P&L: $-22.64 (-1.19%)
- AI3: P&L: $-5.46 (-0.29%)
- AI5: P&L: $-28.69 (-1.51%)
- AI4: P&L: $1.26 (0.07%)
- AI6: P&L: $1.68 (0.09%)

## Next Steps:

1. **Navigate to http://localhost:3000** 
2. **Hard refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Wait for the 2-minute update cycle**

The server is now running fresh with all fixes applied. The P&L should display correctly showing the difference from $1900 baseline.

## If Still Showing 0%:

Try a hard refresh in your browser:
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + F5
- Or: Open DevTools (F12) → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
